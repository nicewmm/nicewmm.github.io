          <span class="ae-u-bolder">Abstract</span>
          <p class="ae-lambda">This article, through the comparison of real-world packaging, digital packaging, and AI packaging, discusses how different forms of packaging under different levels of human participation can trigger different feelings about the relationship between humans and objects, and humans and technology, thereby generating thoughts about the relationship between technological development and human values. This article focuses on the key role of design in promoting the reflection on the relationship between humans and objects, positions AI packaging as a kind of speculative design, and demonstrates through design practice the promotion of this new form of art on human thinking.</p>

          <span class="ae-u-bolder">Abstract</span>
          <p class="ae-lambda">Artificial intelligence is one of the most eye-catching developments in the field of technology in recent years. This article discusses the application of artificial intelligence in logo design and summarizes the ways and characteristics of AI-generated logos. These methods can improve the efficiency of logo design and facilitate public participation. However, at this stage, these methods cannot replace the professional level of experienced graphic designers. With the help of artificial intelligence, logo design has become simpler in some aspects, but it has also raised new issues, making logo design more complex.<br></p>

          <p><b>Wang Yifan</b><br><i>Design Research</i>, 2024, (06)</p>
          <span class="ae-u-bolder">Abstract</span>
          <p class="ae-lambda">In the era of artificial intelligence, machines are no longer merely tools for executing tasks, but are increasingly venturing into creative domains of human beings, including the highly imaginative field of art design. This paper traces the three stages of machine involvement in art design: imitation, assistance, and creation. It then analyzes the current state of artificial intelligence participation in art design, producing a rich visual content through supervised and unsupervised learning. It also examines the uncontrollability of AI design, the lack of innovation, and the limitations of bias and averaging in AI-generated designs. Finally, the paper proposes the trend of co-design development involving human-machine collaboration, including the establishment of intelligent design standards, the creation of high-quality training samples, the expansion of various forms of human-machine communication, and the balance of responsibilities and rights between humans and machines.<br></p>

          <p>Zhao Xuanwu, <b>Wang Yifan</b>, Uradee Amnueypol, Yang Hong<br>19th International Conference on the Arts in Society in 2024 (Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea)</p>
          <span class="ae-u-bolder">Abstract</span>
          <p class="ae-lambda">As AI becomes integrated into artistic works, artists are increasingly focused on the interaction between AI and art forms. This article focuses on surrealism art, researching the expression of AI in surrealistic art creation through examination and comparison. In terms of visual effects, AI can imitate surrealistic works but lacks the expression of human emotions and individual will. This is the most essential difference from actual artist works. However, this research discovers three perspectives on the role of AI in surrealistic art creation aspects: 1. Offering a new mode of creative expression, AI enables humans to convey their imagination into visual form and express themselves through the rapid generation of visual images. 2. Introducing new forms of communication, as communicating with AI allows people to understand and imagine both reality and the surreal. 3. Serving as a new implementing tool, AI becomes an integral part of an artwork and presents the final form of art. This study aims to provide insights into surrealistic art creation in the new era.<br></p>

          <p><b>Wang Yifan</b><br>9th Oriental Design Forum 2023 (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China)</p>
          <span class="ae-u-bolder">Abstract</span>
          <p class="ae-lambda">Design philosophy is the study of design thinking, design concepts, and design methods. The technological revolution has had a profound impact on design and also affects people's thinking about design philosophy. From the Industrial Revolution to the era of artificial intelligence, technology is forcing changes in design. By comparing with history, designers need to recognize the impact of technology from a macro perspective of design philosophy, think about the relationship between people and objects, the relationship between the inside and outside as a whole, and the relationship of human-machine creativity, in order to promote innovation and progress in the design field.</p>

          <span class="ae-u-bolder">Abstract</span>
          <p class="ae-lambda">The stroke order of Chinese characters is a combination of strokes and their sequence in Chinese characters. It is the process between information generation and information reception. It refers to both the order of single strokes and the sequence of multiple strokes. In addition, the term "stroke order" also means convenience and appropriateness, that is, using the stroke order norms can make writing more convenient. By exploring the definition, formation reasons, and related research of stroke order, the article attempts to extract new design thinking and methods, and apply them to new design activities.</p>
